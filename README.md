# Multi-Monitor Detection Tests

[https://csperando.github.io/watcher/](https://csperando.github.io/watcher/)

This application consists of eight separate tests aimed at reproducing 
how a website can detect a second display, usually without 
asking for any permission. A summary of the implementation 
for each of the eight methods is provided below.

## 1. `screen.isExtended`

A boolean on `window.screen` that reports whether the display setup is
extended across multiple screens. No permission prompt required — this is
almost certainly what most sites use, and is likely what tipped you off.

## 2. `getScreenDetails()`

The full Window Management API. Returns an array of every connected screen
with size, position, and primary/internal flags. Requires a user gesture and
an explicit permission grant, so it can't run silently on page load. Each
screen's `label` (a free-form string the OS hands the browser — this VM
reports `"VBOX monitor"`) is also checked against the same virtualization
hint list method 8 uses for the WebGL renderer string. It's a weak signal on
its own (spoofable the same way `isExtended` is — confirmed via the same
CDP-injection technique used against method 6 — and legitimate hardware
sometimes reports generic labels too), but it's a check most stealth tooling
doesn't think to fake specifically.

## 3. Permissions API state (no prompt)

`navigator.permissions.query({ name: "window-management" })` silently reveals
whether that permission is already granted, denied, or unset — without ever
showing a dialog. A prior grant lets a site skip straight to method 2.

## 4. Heuristic: `screen.availLeft` / `availTop`

Non-standard but long-supported properties. A non-zero value suggests a
display positioned to the left of or above the primary one — a hint of a
multi-monitor layout with zero permissions involved.

## 5. Heuristic: window position vs. screen bounds

Polls `window.screenX`/`screenY` against `screen.width`/`height`. If the
window is ever positioned or dragged outside the primary screen's bounds,
another display must exist.

## 6. Tamper / spoof detection for `isExtended`

Users and privacy tools (e.g. Brave, hardened browsers, anti-fingerprinting
extensions) can override `isExtended` to always report `false`. This method
checks whether the property's getter is still native code, and cross-checks
its answer against methods 4 and 5 for consistency.

The native-code check (`scripts/detectors/nativeCode.js`) uses a trusted
`Function.prototype.toString` taken from a hidden, same-origin `about:blank`
iframe (`scripts/detectors/pristine.js`). That iframe has its own fresh set
of built-ins, which a script that patched *this* page hasn't touched. The
check calls it via `.call()` rather than asking the getter to stringify
itself, so a lying per-function `toString` can't intervene. A page-wide
`toString` patch can't either. The getter's source must also match the
pristine realm's copy exactly. That catches a `Proxy` wrapped around the
native getter, which stringifies as an anonymous `function () { [native
code] }`. The check also reports whether this page's `toString` itself has
been replaced (Brave does this legitimately).

## 7. Hardware signal: display refresh-rate (vsync) timing

Counts `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks over a fixed window to measure the
monitor's actual refresh rate from real vsync timing, rather than an
OS-reported flag. Re-measures periodically; a shift in Hz with no
display-settings change usually means the window crossed onto a different
physical screen with a different refresh rate. Grounded in real hardware
timing rather than a settable property, so it's harder to convincingly spoof
than methods 1–6.

## 8. Context signal: is this even physical hardware?

Reads the WebGL renderer/vendor strings, which often name the virtual GPU
driver in a VM (VMware SVGA3D, VirtualBox, Hyper-V) or a software renderer
(llvmpipe, SwiftShader). Doesn't detect monitors directly — it's a trust
modifier for the other seven: inside a VM, virtual display counts are
whatever the hypervisor is configured to present, and method 7's "hardware"
refresh-rate timing is usually a synthetic, hypervisor-emulated 60Hz rather
than a real vsync signal.

## Limitations

- **Feature detection isn't tamper detection.** A missing API (`"isExtended"
  in screen` is `false`) is an honest signal — usually an unsupported browser
  or an enterprise policy. A *present but overridden* API is not detectable
  the same way.
- **The native-code check can still be defeated at a deeper level.** It
  now resists per-function `toString` lies, page-wide `toString` patches and
  `Proxy` wrappers by checking against a pristine iframe realm. A spoofer
  that also reaches into new `about:blank` frames can still defeat it, for
  example an extension with `match_about_blank`/`all_frames`, or a page
  script that hooks `createElement`, `appendChild` or `contentWindow` before
  ours runs. The webcam page checks those hooks too. Beyond that, verifying
  the verifier never fully terminates.
- **Cross-signal checks only catch inconsistency, not truth.** If every
  signal is spoofed in agreement, nothing on this page can tell.
- **Chromium-only for methods 2 and 3.** `getScreenDetails()` and the
  `window-management` permission are not implemented in Firefox or Safari at
  time of writing.
- **Heuristics require interaction.** Methods 4 and 5 can only confirm a
  multi-monitor setup they've actually observed (e.g. after a drag); they
  can't rule one out.
- **Refresh-rate timing is noisy.** OS power throttling, background-tab
  throttling, and CPU load can shift the measured Hz with no monitor change
  involved, producing false positives.
- **True hardware enumeration isn't reachable from a webpage at all.**
  OS-level display APIs (`EnumDisplayMonitors`, `CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayIDs`,
  `xrandr`) are outside the browser sandbox by design. Getting that ground
  truth requires stepping outside the page entirely — a browser extension
  with a native-messaging host, or a desktop companion app — which needs the
  user to install something, a fundamentally different threat model than a
  passive page fingerprinting silently.
- **Virtual machines and remote sessions undermine nearly everything above.**
  Inside a VM (or an RDP/VNC/cloud-desktop session), every guest-OS-reported
  signal — screen count, position, and even refresh-rate timing — reflects
  the hypervisor's virtual display emulation, not physical hardware. A
  session can also dynamically span a client's several physical monitors
  into what the guest sees as a single screen, or the reverse. Method 8's
  renderer check is a hint, not proof: it can miss unusual real GPUs and
  can't detect virtualization that spoofs the renderer string too.

# Phony Webcam Detection Tests

`webcam.html` applies the same approach to cameras: it tries to tell a real
physical webcam from a phony one. Phony here means a virtual camera driver
(OBS Virtual Camera, ManyCam, XSplit VCam, Snap Camera, DroidCam, Chrome's
`--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`) or a script that replaces
`getUserMedia` with a canvas or video stream. Methods 1–3 and 12 run
without permission. Methods 4–11 need the live feed and wait for **Start
camera**. Frames are analyzed in memory and never leave the page.

**Tamper-resistant measurement.** The page opens the camera and reads
pixels through pristine copies of `getUserMedia`, `enumerateDevices`,
`getSettings`, `drawImage`, `getImageData` and `requestVideoFrameCallback`,
taken from a hidden iframe (see method 6 of the monitor page). A script
that patched this page's copies is flagged by method 3, but it can't steer
the measurements. For example, a `getImageData` override that adds fake
noise to a still image is flagged, and method 8 still sees the frozen frames
underneath.

**Hero verdict**, in order of precedence:
1. A tampered camera API (method 3) wins outright.
2. A loop or freeze caught mid-session (method 11) overrides earlier passes.
3. The flash challenge (method 9) decides live vs. phony. If it passes but
   other cards raise strong flags, the verdict is "Live feed, but flagged",
   e.g. a real camera relayed through OBS.
4. Otherwise the page tallies strong and weak flags from methods 3–8 and
   10–11.

## 1. Permissions API state (`camera`)

`navigator.permissions.query({ name: "camera" })` reveals whether camera
access is granted, denied or unset, without a prompt. Shares
`checkPermissionState()` with the monitor page's method 3.

## 2. Device inventory (`enumerateDevices()`)

Counts video inputs. More than one camera is a weak hint, because a virtual
camera usually sits next to the real one. Before permission, browsers may
cap the list at one device per kind and hide labels. Updates live on
`devicechange`.

## 3. Camera API integrity

Compares 15 APIs against their pristine-realm copies, using the same
`isNativeFunction()` helper as monitor method 6:
- the camera APIs (`getUserMedia`, `enumerateDevices`, the `mediaDevices`
  getter, `getSettings`, `getCapabilities`, `applyConstraints`, the track
  `label` getter);
- the APIs a detector reads pixels and time through (`drawImage`,
  `getImageData`, `requestVideoFrameCallback`, `performance.now`,
  `permissions.query`);
- the hooks that could reach into the pristine iframe as it's created
  (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `contentWindow`).

It also flags `getUserMedia`/`enumerateDevices` shadowed on the
`navigator.mediaDevices` instance, and a patched `Function.prototype.toString`
(weak, since Brave does this). Once the camera starts, it checks that the
track comes from a real device: canvas tracks (`requestFrame`/`canvas`) and
deviceIds missing from `enumerateDevices()` are flagged. This catches
script injection, not driver-level virtual cameras.

## 4. Camera label hints + USB ID

Substring-matches the active camera's label against default virtual-camera
names (`VIRTUAL_CAM_HINTS`). A virtual camera that is installed but not in
use is reported but not counted as a flag.

On Windows and Linux, Chromium appends the USB vendor:product ID to USB
camera labels, e.g. `Integrated Webcam (0bda:5583)`. Virtual cameras never
have one. The check calibrates itself against the browser's behavior: a
missing ID is a weak flag only when another camera on the same system *does*
have one. Built-in MIPI cameras (e.g. Surface) have no USB ID either, which
is why it stays weak.

## 5. Hardware shape: `getCapabilities()` + `groupId`

Real UVC webcams expose sensor controls (exposure, white balance,
brightness, focus, zoom…). A webcam with a built-in mic shares a `groupId`
with its audio input. Virtual cameras usually expose neither. If the browser
exposes no such controls at all (mostly outside Chromium), the card reports
"browser limited" rather than a flag.

## 6. Control response

Method 5 reads what the camera *claims*. This drives the first available
of `brightness`, `exposureCompensation` or `exposureTime` to its minimum and
maximum with `applyConstraints`. It measures the picture's mean brightness
at each, then restores the original setting. A real sensor darkens and
brightens by at least 10 levels. A control that is accepted (the setting
reads back changed) but doesn't change the picture is a strong flag: the
capability is advertised, not real. A silently ignored change or an error
is weak. It runs after the frame sample (methods 7–8), since it
deliberately changes the picture.

## 7. Frame timing

Uses `requestVideoFrameCallback` to read each frame's `captureTime`, falling
back to `mediaTime`, over 5 s. A near-zero coefficient of variation in frame
intervals suggests a software render loop. This is only ever a weak flag.

## 8. Pixel noise / frozen / looped feed

Compares the same sampled frames (160×120 grayscale):
- **Frozen.** A real sensor never produces two bit-identical frames; a
  still image does. Frequent exact repeats (weak) point to a source
  re-sending frames.
- **Looped.** Each frame is reduced to a 16×12 block-average fingerprint.
  A replay is a pair of non-adjacent frames closer than 0.3× the sensor-noise
  distance, with a frame in between that moved at least one noise-distance
  away. Two separate exposures can't get that close, because their noise is
  independent. A replayed frame can, even after slight rescaling.
- **Flat noise.** Per-pixel temporal noise is grouped by brightness, with
  moving pixels dropped. After the camera's gamma curve, real sensor noise
  is strongly brightness-dependent: shadows are noisiest, about 2.5× the
  highlights in simulation. Noise added uniformly to a clean image is flat
  (max/min ratio < 1.3), which is a weak flag.

Near-black frames (a covered lens) are not judged.

## 9. Challenge: screen-flash reflection

Flashes the screen through a random red/green/blue sequence (500 ms per
color, under the WCAG three-flashes-per-second limit). It then correlates
each color channel's share of the frame center with the sequence:
- **Significance.** The score is compared with 2,000 reshuffles of the same
  sequence. It passes only if p < 0.005 and the correlation is at least
  0.5. In simulation, fake feeds pass 0.6% of the time.
- **Capture delay.** The step windows are shifted by 0–400 ms and the best
  fit is kept. The shuffles take their best shift too, so the p-value stays
  honest. A delay outside 40–350 ms is a weak flag (instant = synthetic,
  late = relayed).
- **Where the tint lands.** A real face near the screen tints more than
  the background. A whole-frame color filter tints both equally (ratio
  < 1.1), which is a weak flag.

A recorded or synthetic feed can't follow the sequence, because it's chosen
at runtime. An opt-in checkbox re-runs the test at random 1–3 minute
intervals.

## 10. Cross-check: consistency

Independent readings of the same camera should agree:
- reported vs. actual frame size;
- reported vs. measured frame rate (only *more* frames than reported is
  suspicious, since real cameras slow down in dim light);
- the track's label and `groupId` vs. the device list;
- what this page's `getSettings` returns vs. the pristine copy.

One mismatch is weak, and two or more are strong.

## 11. Session monitor

The other cards check once. This keeps watching for the rest of the session:
- **Every frame is hashed** (a 16×12 thumbnail, ~53-bit hash). A frame that
  repeats *exactly* after the scene has moved on at least twice is a loop.
  This catches loops up to 10 minutes long. A real still scene can't
  trigger it, because nothing moved in between.
- **Identical frames for 3 s** are a freeze.
- **Track changes are logged:** mute/unmute/ended events, stalls (no frame
  for 2 s while the tab is visible), and changes of device, label,
  resolution or frame rate (a source switch).

Loops and freezes are strong flags; the rest are weak.

## 12. Context: VM signal

The monitor page's method 8, reused unchanged. Inside a VM or remote session
the camera is redirected or emulated, so treat the sensor cards with
caution.

## Webcam limitations

- **A virtual camera with a real camera behind it passes the sensor tests.**
  If OBS relays a live webcam, the frames really do come from a sensor.
  Timing, noise, control response (if OBS passes controls through) and even
  the flash test can pass. The label and USB-ID card (4) and hardware shape
  (5) are what catch it, and the hero reports "Live feed, but flagged".
- **Labels can be renamed.** Some tools let you rename the driver, and
  determined users can edit it in the registry.
- **`getCapabilities()`/`applyConstraints()` controls are Chromium-centric**,
  and some cheap real webcams expose few controls too.
- **USB IDs are Chromium-on-Windows/Linux only.** Other browsers and macOS
  don't add them, so method 4 reports "can't judge" there.
- **The noise statistics assume a lightly processed sensor.** Heavy in-camera
  temporal denoising can flatten the noise profile (a false "flat noise",
  weak), and noise added *before* a loop is recorded survives replay. Real
  footage looped through a virtual camera is caught by exact repeats, not by
  its noise.
- **Timing is noisy.** Browser scheduling adds jitter even to
  software-paced sources, so method 7 misses a lot.
- **The flash test needs cooperation.** Bright rooms, a distant face, or
  aggressive auto white balance weaken the reflection. It also flashes the
  screen, so it must stay opt-in.
- **The pristine realm can be reached.** An extension injecting into
  `about:blank` frames, or a script that hooks iframe creation, can patch
  the pristine copies too. See the monitor page's limitations.
- **Tuned on synthetic data.** Thresholds (0.3× noise distance, flat ratio
  1.3, p < 0.005, 40–350 ms delay, 10-level control swing) come from
  simulations. They still need checking against real webcams and real
  virtual cameras.
